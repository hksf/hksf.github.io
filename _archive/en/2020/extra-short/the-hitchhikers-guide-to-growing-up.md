title: The Hitchhiker's Guide To Growing Up
director: Brett Chapman
country: United Kingdom
description: Back in 2008 Brett hitchhiked across Europe with his best friend. No smartphones, no Google maps. It was a crazy, formative adventure captured in glorious SD! For the last 10 years that footage has gathered dust on hard drives and tapes - until now! The Hitchhiker's Guide To Growing up is a documentary micro-short.
