title: 300 in 60
director: Andrii Kaplia
country: Ukraine
description: A chaotic outlook on disappointment in fashion industry life. Anastasia signs a contract with BALENCIAGA, but at the last moment she is denied and is being replaced by another model. To comfort her they give her BALENCIAGA T-shirt. As a sublimation, Anastasia makes an abstract expressionism painting on it and here starts her fashion brand with an inappropriate name. Youth maximalism fights with awareness and new vision gets born.
