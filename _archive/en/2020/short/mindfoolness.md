<br/><br/>
Nowadays, with saturated social media, and being expected to instantly respond and to give immediate feedback to family, friends, co-workers or anyone in touch it is almost impossible to be present and to experience the moment.
We developed a “right now” mentality and what used to take time now needs to be done overnight.
<br/><br/>
I created the \"Mindfoolness\" based on the idea that we can meditate and be present without taking everything too seriously. To avoid distractions, or use them as a therapy or meditation.... otherwise we can not really enjoy what we do, and what we love. With all of the stress to keep up with the fast pace of our “digital world” we lose the ability to be mindful, present, free of distractions. In turn, we find ourselves overwhelmed by stress, pressure and hindering our full capability due to the constant distractions. If we could just smile, and be present in our everyday journeys, everything would be a little more relaxed and fun."
