description: "Deceitfully playing with stereotypes, Mantis questions whether identity is something imposed on us or something to be uncovered. The short film follows a young woman of Asian descent fulfilling the expectation of Western society. Slowly, she begins to question whether her actions are simply the result of how she has been conditioned to think and whether ultimately after so many years this has effectively become her identity. Challenging how truly comfortable we feel in our skin, Mantis cleverly poses the question of whoâ€™s in charge of (de)constructing our identity."
