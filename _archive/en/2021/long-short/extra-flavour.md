title: EXTRA FLAVOUR
director: CARLOS ABASCAL PEIRÃ“
country: France
description: Joachim is a very average man in his sixties. But he hides an obsession... or even two to be precise. He can't help but stare at the men who go to the gym across the street from his house while he devours pickles. When a new jar, "easy opening" won't open, his world turns upside down!
