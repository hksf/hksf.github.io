description: "Shadows Roses is a visual representation of texts extracted from works by Ingeborg Bachmann. <br><br/>From the poems \"Shadows Roses\" and \"Storm of roses\" we create a dreamlike world that speaks about the search for the primal essence, the need for freedom and the confrontation with one's own ghosts."
