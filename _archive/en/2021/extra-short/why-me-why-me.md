description: "A voluminous dress on a pale priestess, an oversized kimono coat reveals more than it covers. Untamed tips of hair flash out from under a habit. This fashion clip, which stages the collection of the young graduate of the Academy of Fine Arts in Łódź, Marlena Czak, combines elements of reality, fiction and religion into a fairy tale about fashion and myth."
