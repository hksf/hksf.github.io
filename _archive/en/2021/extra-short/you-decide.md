description: "Who am I? And who do I actually aspire to be? Do I feel comfortable with the person that I am right now? <b/><b/> These existential questions are timeless. We all have to face them -sooner or later. <b/><b/> The Ad is about a young woman, who, in the midst of quarantine, is struggling to find her style and identity. The different glasses/frames stand for different styles and personality traits. She tries all of them out, because she has the freedom of choice, thanks to the \"Home Try-On\"- option from ace&tate eyewear."
