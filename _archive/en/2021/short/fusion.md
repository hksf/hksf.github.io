description: "Fusion is a phenomenon, the manifestation of art in multiple forms of expression. <br/><br/> Magnetically drawn to a place, they surrender, exploring their limits to transcend their physical form. They melt like gold, sparkle, blend, and with a bang, everything is transformed. <br/><br/> This experience gives them the possibility to add, to flow, to change. It is the desire for mystery, for the new, for renewal, that makes them fuse."
